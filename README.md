### 2. Installation
Install all dependencies in root, server, and client with:

```bash
# In the root directory:
npm install
npm --prefix server install
npm --prefix client install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

#### Backend (`server/.env`):
```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/clientportal
JWT_SECRET=clientflow_jwt_secret_super_secure_key_2026_hackathon
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Optional: Cloudinary credentials (If omitted, files are saved locally in /uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```

#### Frontend (`client/.env`):
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

## 🧪 Database Seeding

Populate the database with demo accounts, a sample project, tasks, milestones, deliverables, comments, activities, and notifications:

```bash
cd server
npm run seed
```
